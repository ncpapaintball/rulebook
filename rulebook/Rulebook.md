        1. If the meaning of any portion of this rulebook is unclear the simplest interpretation and the one most consistent with the body of the rules is most likely the correct one. Omissions are not loopholes. When examples are provided they are not intended to be the sum of all possibilities, but simply representative examples.

        1. Any call made by the head referee on their field is final.
        1. The Ultimate Referee will not overturn any on-field calls by a head referee.
        1. The Ultimate Referee is the highest authority at an event in regards to play-of-the-game or on field disputes.
            1. The role of the Ultimate Referee at sanctioned events is played by NCPA league officials, who should be contacted during a sanctioned event to resolve questions regarding game rules or enforcement.
        1. Any decision of the Ultimate Referee is final.

    1. High School
        1. All players on a team must attend the same high school, with limited exceptions noted below. It is NOT necessary for your team to be officially recognized by your school. The ONLY requirement is that all of your players are eligible.

            1. Any student who is enrolled at that high school.
            1. Any student who attends a ‘magnet’ school, but would attend the public high school if they elected not to attend the magnet school. To be considered a ‘magnet’ school, the school must accept students who would normally go to several different high schools were they not attending the magnet school, and enrollment in the magnet school must be voluntary. Voluntary means that, if the student wanted to, they could leave the magnet school AND they would then attend the team’s public high school.
            1. Any student who is home schooled, but would attend the school if they enrolled in public school.
            1. Any student who is enrolled in junior high school, and will attend the school when they graduate from their junior high school.

    1. The event score for a team is determined by the formula
    $$ 90 + \frac{\text{Number of Teams Competing} - \text{Your Place}}{\text{Number Of Teams Competing} - 1} + 10 $$

    1. If there is a tie in the number of ranking points,
        1. The team with the highest number of ranking points earned in events in that division in the current season in which the team appeared in the finals will be ranked higher.  If the tie remains after comparing team performance in the finals, compare ranking points earned in events in which the teams were eliminated in the semi-final round, and if still necessary, evens in which the teams were eliminated in the quarterfinal round.
        1. If the first tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest combined margin of victory in the Finals of all tournaments in which the team appeared will be ranked higher.
            1. If a team did not appear in the finals of a particular tournament, count the margin for that tournament as 0.
        1. If the second tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest combined margin of victory in the next earliest round of the events in which the team appeared is ranked higher, comparing successively earlier tournament rounds until the tie is broken.
        1. If the third tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest ranking at the end of the preceding season will be ranked higher.
        1. If the fourth tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team from the school with the smallest undergraduate enrollment will be ranked higher.

            1. Penalty time begins running when the player serving the penalty enters the penalty box.
            1. Penalty time only runs when the match clock is running.

[^competitor]: A competitor is any person present on the field of play equipped to compete in a team’s match during an active point and exhibiting an association with the competing team.

[^same_number_of_teams]: Same number  of teams from each bracket

[^all_tiebreakers]: Including all tiebreakers

[^loose_material]: Subject to specific requirements by the head referee on the field of play as per 5.1.13

[^underclothing_padding]: Any item containing padding of any nature will not be considered underclothing but will be considered protective gear.

[^cleats]: Similar “cleats” are often found on baseball cleat.

[^headwear_example]: As an example, one sandanna and one beanie or one headband and one sandanna.

[^oversided_clothing_how_to_measure]: The article of clothing should be grabbed at a single point and pulled away from the body or limb. Once this has been done, the clothing should be pinched on opposite sides of this point so these two points are brought together next to the body or limb.  The clothing will then be tight around the body or limb, with any extra clothing pulled through the pinch and held at the original grab point.

[^astm_goggles]: Goggle manufacturers must submit independent laboratory test results to the promoter at least 10 days prior to the start of a tournament demonstrating the goggle system meets or exceeds ASTM standards for any system such manufacturer wishes to be allowed for use during that tournament.

[^cracks_are_bad_mmkay]: Cracks in the lens, however slight, affect the ability of the goggles to protect the player.

[^no_penalty_for_losing_mask]: This does not apply to players who accidentally lose their mask during an active point.

[^goggle_accessories_are_ok]: Goggle fans and decorative additions that are not padded or absorbent are acceptable.

[^padding_hits_are_majors]: Hits on padding are obvious and subject to a major penalty.  Players should not wear so much padding that they cannot feel hits.

[^no_hair_triggers]: They may operate if and only if the trigger is pulled, and shall not fire if it is hit, dropped, shaken or sneezed on.

[^electronic_components]: Batteries, circuit boards, chips, wires, etc…

[^ramping_description]: If the trigger is pulled one, two or three times, the marker shall fire no more than the number of times the trigger is pulled. Essentially any marker capable of ramping must shoot three rounds in semi-auto before ramping. The marker may then fire up to three balls per pull after that. Specifically, if more than one second has elapsed since the last shot and the trigger is pulled three times only three paintball may be fired. 

[^mechanical_trigger_release]: Once the marker is fired, the player must reduce the force applied to the trigger and allow the trigger to travel forward past the firing point and then reapply the force on the trigger and bring the trigger back past the firing point before the marker may fire again, i.e., no bounce.

[^no_reactive_triggers]: No reactive triggers.  The trigger force may change as the position of the trigger changes, but the force exerted against the trigger finger at any given trigger position should not change, for example, as a result of the marker firing.

[^tournament_locks]: Essentially, anything that can adjust velocity, shot mode, de-bounce, etc., must be locked.

[^air_tank_removal]: This exception only applies to screwing in or unscrewing the air source – any settings on the air tank itself must not be adjustable without the use of tools.

[^barrel_sock]: Notice this does not say barrel swab, squeegee or plug.  It must be a barrel sock manufactured specifically for paintball markers.

[^how_best_of_three_works]: With four opponents, a team will play one point against each opponent, A, B, C then D. Then a second point will be played against each opponent, then third point as necessary.

[^active_player_can_hang_for_opponent]: Note this does not say an active player from the team scoring the point; players are welcome to hang flags for their opponents.

[^refs_dont_let_dead_players_score_points]: A referee will avoid signaling a flag hang if a player who appears to be eliminated attempts to hang the flag.  The referee will signal a point score once the player has been verified as active.

[^offender_still_serves_penalty]: The offending player still serves a 2-minute penalty beginning with the next point.

[^how_tiebreakers_work]: Head-to-head tiebreakers are applied by comparing the group of all teams with the same match score and number of wins in the following manner:

    1. A team wins the head-to-head tiebreaker if the team
        
        a. Has, for any opponent played in the current round, won more matches in the current round against that opponent than lost; and
        
        b. Is, for any opponent not played in the current round, ranked ahead of that opponent in the remaining tiebreakers.
    
    2. If no team wins the tiebreakers as in (1.), a team loses the head-to-head tiebreaker if the team
    
        a. Has, for any opponent played in the current, lost more matches in the current round against that opponent than won; and
    
        b. Is, for any opponent not played in the current round, ranked behind that opponent in the remaining tiebreakers.
    
    3. If no team wins or loses the head-to-head tiebreakers as in (1.) or (2.) (For example, three teams have played each other and each won once), proceed to successive tiebreakers until a tiebreaker is reached where at least one team is not tied with the others.
    
        a. If one team wins that tiebreaker, they are removed from the tied group and the remaining teams in the tie should have their tie broken starting with the very first tiebreaker, otherwise
    
        b. Split the tied teams into two groups; the first group with all tied to win that tiebreaker, and the other group with the remaining teams, then break the ties for each group separately starting with the very first tiebreaker.  All teams from the first group are ranked ahead of all teams from the second group.
    
    4. Once a team has won or lost the tiebreaker, remove it from the group assigning it the highest rank for a win or the lowest rank for a loss, and then start back at step one with the remaining teams in the group, repeating until only one team remains.

[^time_remaining_in_wins]: Total of time remaining in each match won.

[^time_elapsed_in_losses]: Total of time elapsed in each match lost.

[^how_reset_tiebreakers_works]: Total points scored minus total points given up in all matches in the current round.

[^scorekeepers_responsibilities]: A scorekeeper is not required to hunt a team down to show them the score sheet.  A team has a right to see the final score sheet and should do so to verify the scores are recorded properly.

[^scoring_errors]: This allows teams to do the “right thing” if they agree on a scoring error.  If two teams are intentionally doing the wrong thing to fix the score, they should be dealt with as any other team intentionally fixing scores.

[^scoreboard_errors]: The scoreboard is ONLY the scoreboard – copying scores to the scoreboard wrong, or calculations in error on the scoreboard, will be corrected by scorekeepers.  The scoreboard does NOT include score sheets.

[^stay_off_the_field]: This effectively establishes a minor penalty for entering the field of play at any time without a referee’s approval or checking in.

[^enter_the_field_timely]: It is the player’s responsibility to be on the field during the break period in a sufficient timely manner to allow a referee to chrono the player’s marker.  A player not chronographed prior to the start of a point is subject to immediate elimination.

[^elaborate_on_player_status]: During a point, a player is always active, inactive, or eliminated. Inactive is when a player is out of the point and his shouts should not count, but the player would not be expected to know he was out of the point (i.e. the player’s foot touches tapeline, then the player bunkers two people – the player should be eliminated with no penalty and the two people bunkered should be left in).  Eliminated is when a player should know they should not still be playing, either because a referee has told them they are eliminated, or because they have an obvious hit, or because they were never on the field at the start of the point to begin with.  Thus, when assessing appropriate penalties, a referee must only determine whether the player was active, inactive, or eliminated when the infraction was committed.

[^leaving_start_gate_early]: Leaving early and failing to touch your barrel to the start station prior to the start of a point both result in a change of status to “inactive” and liable to be eliminated by the referee. “Tagging up” restores a player’s active status but does not undue any subsequent results, for example, player is hit and eliminated making the effort to return to start station and “tag up” moot.

[^immediately_eliminated]: Note that in these rules, the phrases “is active” and “ is eliminated” means the player’s status is IMMEDIATELY and AUTOMATICALLY changed to inactive or eliminated, respectively, without any action by the referee.  The phrase “eliminated by a referee” means the player maintains their current status until a referee informs them that they are eliminated, either verbally or by signal.

[^extra_minor_penalty]: The minor penalty is in addition to any eliminations/playing on penalties.  If the player is not hit and avoided the official, that player is eliminated.  If the player is inactive and avoided, they are eliminated (for being inactive) and a teammate is eliminated (for the minor penalty).  If the player has an obvious hit, they are eliminated, a teammate is eliminated (playing on) and another teammate is eliminated (official avoidance).  If the referee determines the player was unaware of the official’s approach there is no avoidance penalty.

[^physical_control]: Merely touching equipment does not establish physical control.  Generally, any equipment that will advance with the player if the player advanced can be considered to be in the physical control of the player.  This includes bunkers – so if you move a bunker because you accidentally run into it, you’re ok, but if you intentionally move the bunker, you’re eliminated.

[^possession_description]: If you start the point with an item or are transferred it, you possess it, and if any such item is hit by a paintball that breaks the player is subject to elimination.

[^disposable_co2]: Does not include disposable CO2 cartridges.

[^possession_minor_penalty]: Taking possession of any item in any other manner results in a minor penalty.

[^pull_an_extra_player]: This means that in addition to getting a one-for-one for playing on, an additional player should be pulled for any opponent the playing-on player manages to shoot, whether the opponent is erroneously eliminated by a referee or not.

[^what_is_a_hit]: Notice it say breaking on a player or any equipment in a player’s possession OR any mark indicating such a strike.  This means a paintball breaking on a player or their equipment that does not leave a visible mark is still a valid hit. 

[^what_is_an_obvious_hit]: If it hits the hopper and sprays on your goggles, it’s obvious.  If it smacks into your ear flap, it’s obvious.  If it hits your facemask and sprays on your face, it’s obvious.  If it hits your elbow pad and that pad is 2” thick and you don’t feel it, it’s still obvious – players should not wear padding so thick they cannot feel hits.  If it grazes off the side of your hopper where you can’t see the hit or it’s in your pack then it may not be obvious if the referee does not have any reason to believe you should know a paintball hit you there.

[^players_must_call_themselves_out]: It is the player’s responsibility to call themselves out when they have an obvious hit.  It is the referees’ job to penalize players who continue to play with an obvious hit, so if you call a referee over to check a hit you could have checked yourself, expect a penalty too.  If called for a paint check and the referee deems the hit to be an obvious hit a major penalty will be assessed.

[^immediately_eliminate_unobvious_hit_players]: If a referee observes a player receive an unobvious hit, the referee should eliminate that player immediately without penalty.  If a referee finds an unobvious hit on a player, the referee will eliminate that player and assess a minor penalty as the referee does not know how long the player has been playing with the hit nor does he know what type of impact the player has had on the point while playing as an inactive player.

[^dead_players_cant_hang_flag]: A referee should not signal a flag hang if an inactive or eliminated player attempts to hang the flag.

[^no_active_players_between_points]: Note that there are no active players between points, so any penalties assessed after the end of the point becomes penalty minutes. This includes specifically penalties for a player who hangs the flag dirty – the team receives penalty minutes, even if they had bodies remaining this point.

[^penalty_includes_flag_carrier_after_hang]: This includes penalties assessed to the flag carrier after the hang.  Thus a team will be assessed two penalty minutes for a flag carrier who hangs with an obvious hit and one penalty minute for a carrier who hangs with an unobvious hit.

[^referee_must_pull_an_active_player]: Note the rule states one active player will be eliminated. If when a referee gets to the active player to be eliminate for the penalty and finds the player has already been eliminated due to a valid hit the referee must then find a different player that is active to pull for the penalty.
 
[^next_three_points_regardless_of_opponent]: Next three points regardless of opponent. The team does not play short if an alternate is available.

[^suspension_area]: The area will be near the scoring table.  This is to prevent suspended players from becoming sideline coaches.
